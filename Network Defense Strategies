a. Design defense mechanisms using firewalls, IDS/IPS, and monitoring tools

Firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules, blocking unauthorized access.

IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors traffic and alerts administrators when suspicious activity is detected.

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) not only detects threats but also blocks or stops them automatically.

Monitoring tools continuously track network activity, logs, and performance to identify anomalies or attacks early.

👉 Together, these tools help protect the network from both external and internal threats.

b. Plan layered defense approaches

A layered defense (Defense in Depth) uses multiple security controls at different levels of the network.

If one layer fails, another layer can still protect the system.

Example layers include:

Network layer (firewalls, IDS/IPS)

Endpoint layer (antivirus, endpoint protection)

Application layer (secure authentication, access controls)

Data layer (encryption, backups)

👉 This approach reduces the risk of a single point of failure.

c. Consider proactive vs. reactive security strategies

Proactive security focuses on preventing attacks before they happen.

Examples: regular patching, vulnerability scanning, security hardening, employee awareness.

Reactive security focuses on responding after an attack occurs.

Examples: incident response, log analysis, containment, and recovery actions.

👉 A strong network defense uses both proactive measures to reduce risks and reactive measures to handle incidents effectively.
