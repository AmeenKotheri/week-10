Log Analysis for Threats

Log analysis is the process of collecting, reviewing, and examining logs generated by systems, applications, and network devices to identify security threats, attacks, or abnormal behavior.

a. Collect and Analyze Network Logs / Events
What are logs?

Logs are records of activities or events that happen in a system or network.

Common sources of network logs

Firewalls – allowed/blocked traffic

Routers & switches – connection attempts, routing events

Servers – login attempts, errors

Applications – user actions, failures

IDS/IPS systems – detected threats

Log collection

Logs are collected using:

SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar)

Syslog servers

Cloud logging services

Log analysis

Reviewing timestamps

Checking source & destination IPs

Monitoring failed logins

Identifying unusual traffic volumes

👉 Goal: Understand what is happening in the network.

b. Detecting Suspicious Activity or Potential Intrusions

This step focuses on identifying abnormal or malicious behavior from logs.

Examples of suspicious activities

Multiple failed login attempts (brute-force attack)

Login from unknown or foreign IP addresses

Sudden spike in network traffic

Accessing restricted files or systems

Unusual port scanning activities

How detection works

Rule-based detection (predefined rules)

Behavior-based detection (normal vs abnormal behavior)

Signature-based detection (known attack patterns)

👉 Goal: Detect possible attacks before damage occurs.

c. Investigate Logs for Attack Patterns

Once suspicious activity is found, logs are investigated deeply to confirm an attack.

Common attack patterns in logs

Brute-force attack

Many failed logins from one IP

DDoS attack

Massive traffic from multiple IPs

Malware infection

Repeated connections to suspicious domains

Privilege escalation

Normal user suddenly gaining admin access

Data exfiltration

Large data transfers at odd times

Investigation steps

Identify the source IP

Check time and frequency

Correlate logs from multiple devices

Match behavior with known attack patterns

Confirm whether it’s a false positive or real threat

👉 Goal: Understand how the attack happened and its impact.
