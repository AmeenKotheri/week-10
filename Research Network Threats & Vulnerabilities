1. Malware

Malware is malicious software designed to damage, steal data, or disrupt systems.
Examples include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.
It can enter a network through infected emails, downloads, or unsafe websites.

2. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

A DDoS attack floods a server or network with massive traffic from multiple systems, making it unavailable to real users.
The main goal is to crash or slow down services.

3. Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or bank details.
It usually happens through fake emails, messages, or websites that look legitimate.

b. Commonly Exploited Vulnerabilities
1. Unpatched Systems

Outdated software and operating systems contain known security flaws that attackers can exploit easily.

2. Weak Passwords

Simple or reused passwords allow attackers to gain unauthorized access using brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.

3. Misconfigured Access Controls

Incorrect permission settings may allow users or attackers to access sensitive data they shouldn’t.

4. Vulnerable Applications

Web applications with poor coding (e.g., SQL injection, XSS flaws) can be exploited to steal or manipulate data.

c. Network Misconfigurations
1. Open or Unused Ports

Leaving unnecessary ports open increases the attack surface for hackers.

2. Improper Firewall Rules

Incorrect firewall settings may allow unauthorized traffic into the network.

3. Default Credentials

Using default usernames and passwords on routers, switches, or servers is a major security risk.

4. Poor Network Segmentation

Not separating networks (e.g., guest and internal networks) allows attackers to move freely once inside.
